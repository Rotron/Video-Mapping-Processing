# Video-Mapping-Processing
A simple video mapping implementation in Processing 3

The idea behind this is to simulate a simple video mapping implementation while utilizing a midi
controller to switch between pre-loaded videos. by pressing the 1,2,3,4 -- 5,6,7,8 -- q,w,e,r
keys it will allow you to place the verticies of a quadrolateral at the location of the mouse
within a sketch window, which allows you to map a video if you are projecting at odd angles.
If you have a midi controller you can assign the sliders and buttons to RGBA values associated
with each frame of each different video. I am aware that this is not the most efficient way
of doing this, however it does prove the concept that it could be done quickly and more
precisely in Processing. 

Utilize this build and modify it however you please!
If you do something cool with it I would like to see it!
